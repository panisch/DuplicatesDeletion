This script will find any duplicate files in a given directory. Files are called duplicates when they have the same size and the same hash value (MD5). For convienience a simple graphical user interface was written with Tkinter, which is integrated in pythons standard library. 
I hope you find this script useful and I would be happy for any feedback.
Acknowlegement: The script was inspired by https://github.com/dpbrown/Duplicate-Files.
